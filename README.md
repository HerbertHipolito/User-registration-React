# Hello, Welcome to my first React application

## A simple registration page made while I was studying React.

I have been studying **React** for some weeks to improve my front-end skill and, here, I show part of my knowledge of that Framework and its main functionalities. In this project, you can register and list users and their data such as name, last name, and email. The initial users are obtained from reqres API, Check out the link: https://reqres.in/.

To verify the functionalities of this application, click on one of the top-right buttons in the header. You can also see the evolution of the development of this application by checking the branches I have created as I progressed in my studies.
